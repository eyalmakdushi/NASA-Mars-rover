<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>This project is an interactive Mars Rover image explorer, 
enabling users to delve into the vast repository of imagery captured by 
NASA's Mars rovers. Equipped with an intuitive user interface, 
it empowers users to select their preferred Mars rover, 
pinpoint a specific date or Martian sol, and handpick a 
camera for their exploration.</p>

<h3>Functionality:</h3>

At first, Pick a Mars Rover: From a dropdown menu populated with the names of active Mars rovers, users can select their desired exploration vehicle.
Then specify Date, choose camera with the dropdown, then click search button to display results.

<p> The users can save the images to their favorites, and display them on full size.
Users can access saved images through a carousel interface by initiating the "Start carousel".


<h2> Important Notes:</h2>
<p> Prior to initiating image searches, it's imperative for users to 
confirm their selection of a Mars rover, 
define a valid date or sol, and specify a camera. 
Should users overlook or input invalid data, 
the application promptly provides error notifications to assist them 
through the process. Furthermore, users enjoy the flexibility of 
toggling between the search form and the saved images container, 
enhancing their browsing convenience.

To access the list of saved images, users must simply click on the
"Home" icon and then proceed to the save segment.
This ensures a fluid transition between exploration and reviewing saved imagery.
